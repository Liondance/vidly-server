# vidly-server

Vidly-server is an node.js based server (express) for a fictitious video rental application.
The corresponding vidly-client project is a React based Web client for the same application.

These projects are part of an online course I highly recommend:

- Instructor: Mosh Hamedani

The code was written by myself (Liondance) while making progress on the course.
